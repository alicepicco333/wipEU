    "## Introduction\n",
    "The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is an agency of the European Union (EU) that was established in 2006 with the aim of promoting gender equality and combating discrimination based on sex. EIGE collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on various aspects of gender equality to support evidence-based policymaking within the EU. \n",
    "\n",
    "One key area of focus for EIGE is the representation of women and men in decision-making positions. The agency's Gender Statistics Database provides a comprehensive collection of statistical information related to gender equality, including data on women and men in decision-making roles across different sectors at European level. In terms of decision-making positions, EIGE monitors indicators such as the proportion of women and men in political, economic, and social leadership roles. This includes positions in national governments, parliaments, and local authorities, as well as leadership roles in business and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "EIGE's database helps identify gender imbalances and trends over time, providing policymakers with valuable insights to design and implement measures that promote greater gender equality. Achieving gender balance in decision-making positions is a key goal for the EU, as it is seen as essential for democratic representation and effective governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "EIGE's work contributes to tracking progress and identifying areas where further efforts are needed to address gender disparities. By promoting transparency and accountability, the agency plays a crucial role in advancing gender equality within the European Union. Policymakers can use the data and analyses provided by EIGE to develop targeted interventions and policies aimed at addressing the underrepresentation of women in decision-making positions and promoting equal opportunities for both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the data in EIGE's Gender Statistics Database is regularly updated to reflect the evolving landscape of gender equality in the European Union. Policymakers, researchers, and the public can access this valuable resource to stay informed about progress and challenges in achieving gender equality, particularly in decision-making roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we opted to formulate our unique conceptual framework to delve into the data, exploring statistical correlations and longitudinal trends. Our objective was to visualize the temporal evolution through the creation of choropleth maps and line charts. Additionally, we aimed to identify clusters within the dataset and analyze correlations to derive deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: \"How do the levels of representation of women in different decision-making positions correlate within the European Union? Is there a discernible pattern or trend in the relationships between women occupying various roles, and how have these correlations evolved over time?\""

    "Data is generally released within one month of the data collection.\n",
    "The methodology used is the wmid\n",
    "All the data that we have gathered follows the WMID (women and men in Decision-Making) methodology which is a tool developed by the EIGE to monitor the participation of women in Decision-Making, starting from local and arriving to national levels of governance; the key principles of this method are based on: data-driven, since it relies on reliable and comprable data from a variety of sources, mainly from the websites and other publications produced by the reference organisation, some of the data is also collected by direct contact with the various organisations; gender-sensitive, it takes into account the different exeperiences and perspectives of women and men in decision-making; comparative since it allows for comparison between different countries and regions, even thou some there are some limitations to the extent to which data can be considered as fully comparable between countries.\n",
    "The data of the EIGE is collected by researchers which are subjected to routine validation like: cross-checking of the data relating to at least 10% of organisation covered by aother researcher; verification of the data with the concerned organisation; comparison of data with previous periods and the review in case there are drastic changes of the data.\n",

    "## Technical analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines the step-by-step process of analyzing a dataset related to the influential roles of women in various domains, focusing on factors such as research funding organizations, major political parties, and national ministries dealing with the environment and climate change. The objective is to understand correlations, trends, and patterns within the data and identify clusters representing similar temporal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Step: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial step involves reading the data in xlsx format and converting it to csv for efficient analysis using the **`pandas`** library. In this phase, several crucial functions are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`force_to_numeric`**: This function addresses the challenge of inconsistent data types by converting values in selected columns to numeric. This is particularly important as some datasets may have non-numeric values, possibly due to NaN values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`knn_impute`**: This multifaceted function first determines the ideal number of neighbors and then utilizes this parameter to impute missing data in the merged datasets. The algorithm includes selecting numeric data, cross-validation for k selection, identifying optimal k, and final imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`column_remove`**: Designed to equalize datasets, this function limits the analysis to columns referring to data from 2018 onwards (it is worth to mention that analyses have been applied also to complete datasets without major changings in the overall results.). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`generate_overall_trend_correlation`**: A function dedicated to calculating the overall correlation of a dataset based on the difference of individual values taken and compared year by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`generate_yearly_correlations`**: Similar to the previous function, this one generates correlations between the absolute values of each instance taken individually year by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is prepared, the analysis begins by examining correlations using the `column_remove` and `force_to_numeric` functions to focus on data from 2018 to 2023. Two main functions are employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`generate_overall_trend_correlation`**: Examines the correlation between the absolute values of the columns, providing insights into general trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`generate_yearly_correlations`**: Looks at the correlation between the trends or changes in values over time for each column. Particularly useful when understanding how trends in values for common columns correlate between two dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying these functions, the `column_remove` and `force_to_numeric` functions are used to ensure a standardized dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct broader analyses, datasets sharing common columns, such as 'Geographic region,' are merged. This step is crucial for identifying correlations and patterns across different influential roles of women in various regions. After the merge, the `knn_impute` function is applied to address missing values (NaN) in the dataset, replacing them by estimating based on the values of the most similar observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `knn_impute` algorithm follows a logical sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a dataset with features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable), the k-NN algorithm computes the distance (commonly Euclidean distance) between the data point with missing values and all other data points in the dataset.\n",
    "2. It identifies the k nearest neighbors (data points with the smallest distances) to the data point with missing values.\n",
    "3. The algorithm then imputes missing values with the average (or weighted average) of the target values of its k nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the `KNNImputer` class in `scikit-learn` handles the complexities of the k-NN imputation algorithm, including distance metrics, weights, and handling missing values in the input data. The optimal k is selected based on cross-validated mean squared error scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spearman's Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "To further investigate and identify interesting correlation trends, Spearman's correlation is applied. This non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables is particularly useful when dealing with non-linear data. Unlike Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation does not assume a linear relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman's correlation process involves ranking data points for each variable, ordering them from lowest to highest, computing the differences between the ranks, squaring these differences, and calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\[ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} \\]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( \\rho \\) is the number of data points, and \\( d_i \\) represents the differences in ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's correlation is advantageous when dealing with non-linear relationships, capturing monotonic (increasing or decreasing) relationships. This makes it more suitable for assessing associations in datasets where the relationship between variables is not strictly linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical analysis of the Spearman correlation matrix provides details on the strength of correlations and potential influences between categories. Key observations from the numerical values include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal Correlations within the Same Categories: Generally high correlations within the same categories over the years, indicating a strong positive correlation. This suggests that gender dynamics in one category positively influence dynamics in similar categories in subsequent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlations between Different Categories in the Same Year: Varied correlations, often significant. A high value indicates a positive relationship, while a low or negative value indicates a weaker or even negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlations Between Different Categories Over the Years: Significant variations over time, suggesting that gender dynamics in an agency in one year may influence other categories differently in subsequent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negative Values in Year-to-Year Correlations: Indicate an inverse relationship between categories in specific years. This suggests that, in certain periods, an increase in the number of women in one category is associated with a decrease in other categories and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlations between Agencies in the Same Year: Reflect how gender dynamics in one agency may be linked to those in other agencies during the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heatmap of Spearman's Correlation for Non-linear Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A heatmap of Spearman's correlation provides a visual representation of non-linear relationships within the dataset. The heatmap is useful for understanding correlations within the same domains across years, between different domains in the same year, and between different domains across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation within the Same Domains Across Years: Warm colors (e.g., red) along the diagonal indicate a strong positive correlation within the same domain in consecutive years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation between Different Domains in the Same Year: Cells not on the diagonal represent the correlation between different domains in the same year. Warm colors indicate a positive relationship, while cool colors indicate a weaker or negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation between Different Domains Across Years: Cells neither on the diagonal nor in the same year show the correlation between different domains across years. Cool colors suggest that these domains are not strongly correlated over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clusters and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, a different analysis approach is employed to identify patterns in the dataset. Before proceeding with cluster identification, the elbow method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters for partitioning the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elbow Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The elbow method is a technique used to find the optimal number of clusters in a dataset for clustering algorithms, such as K-Means. It involves plotting the variance explained by the clusters against the number of clusters and observing the point at which adding more clusters does not significantly improve the variance explained. This point, visualized as an \"elbow\" in the plot, is considered the optimal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the elbow method plot suggests adopting two clusters, a decision is made to opt for three clusters instead. This decision is based on the averages of the values within\n",
    "\n",
    " each individual cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D Visualization with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insights into the dataset's patterns, a 3D visualization is created using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, allowing for better visualization and understanding of relationships between variables. The reduction of dimensionality is crucial for several reasons, including data visualization, noise reduction, computational efficiency, avoiding the curse of dimensionality, and multicollinearity reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first principal component is a linear combination of the original variables, capturing the majority of the variance in the data. It is determined by the PCA algorithm during the analysis, and each term in the expression represents a weight multiplied by the value of the corresponding original variable. The positive or negative sign of each weight indicates the direction and strength of the relationship between the original variable and the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D graph represents each category by a point, with the position along the X-axis determined by the value of the first principal component, the position along the Y-axis determined by the second principal component, and the position along the Z-axis determined by the third principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained clusters represent different geographical regions that exhibit similar patterns in the number of women in influential roles over the years. Regions within the same cluster have more similar temporal change patterns compared to agencies in different clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion for clustering the data is based on the Euclidean distance between points in a multidimensional space, where each dimension represents a year. The KMeans algorithm aims to minimize the variance within each cluster, which is the sum of squared distances between each point and the centroid of its cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this comprehensive data analysis and clustering approach provide valuable insights into the influential roles of women in various domains over the years. The utilization of diverse functions, correlation analyses, and clustering techniques contributes to a thorough exploration of the dataset. The identified clusters offer a nuanced understanding of geographical regions with similar gender dynamics. Further investigations and detailed analyses could uncover additional patterns and contribute to a more profound understanding of gender dynamics in European institutions over time.\n"
