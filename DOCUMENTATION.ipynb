    "## Introduction\n",
    "The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is an agency of the European Union (EU) that was established in 2006 with the aim of promoting gender equality and combating discrimination based on sex. EIGE collects, analyzes, and disseminates data on various aspects of gender equality to support evidence-based policymaking within the EU. \n",
    "\n",
    "One key area of focus for EIGE is the representation of women and men in decision-making positions. The agency's Gender Statistics Database provides a comprehensive collection of statistical information related to gender equality, including data on women and men in decision-making roles across different sectors at European level. In terms of decision-making positions, EIGE monitors indicators such as the proportion of women and men in political, economic, and social leadership roles. This includes positions in national governments, parliaments, and local authorities, as well as leadership roles in business and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "EIGE's database helps identify gender imbalances and trends over time, providing policymakers with valuable insights to design and implement measures that promote greater gender equality. Achieving gender balance in decision-making positions is a key goal for the EU, as it is seen as essential for democratic representation and effective governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "EIGE's work contributes to tracking progress and identifying areas where further efforts are needed to address gender disparities. By promoting transparency and accountability, the agency plays a crucial role in advancing gender equality within the European Union. Policymakers can use the data and analyses provided by EIGE to develop targeted interventions and policies aimed at addressing the underrepresentation of women in decision-making positions and promoting equal opportunities for both genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the data in EIGE's Gender Statistics Database is regularly updated to reflect the evolving landscape of gender equality in the European Union. Policymakers, researchers, and the public can access this valuable resource to stay informed about progress and challenges in achieving gender equality, particularly in decision-making roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we opted to formulate our unique conceptual framework to delve into the data, exploring statistical correlations and longitudinal trends. Our objective was to visualize the temporal evolution through the creation of choropleth maps and line charts. Additionally, we aimed to identify clusters within the dataset and analyze correlations to derive deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "RQ: \"How do the levels of representation of women in different decision-making positions correlate within the European Union? Is there a discernible pattern or trend in the relationships between women occupying various roles, and how have these correlations evolved over time?\""
