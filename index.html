          <p><b>wipEU</b> is an open data project focused on analyzing the correlation between the representation of women in diverse positions
             across the European Union and its evolution over time. Our project aims to examine factors influencing the presence of women
              in positions of <b>Power & Decision Making</b> in the EU, with a particular emphasis on understanding how these dynamics change and develop over different time periods.<br><br>
              By examining data and trends, we aim to uncover insights into the progress, challenges, and trends related to gender representation within the EU.

Through comprehensive data analysis, we seek to contribute valuable knowledge that can inform discussions, policies, 
and actions aimed at fostering greater gender equity in the European Union. <b>wipEU</b> stands at the intersection of data-driven
 insights and the pursuit of a more inclusive and representative future in positions of influence and decision-making across the EU landscape.<br><br>

          <p>
           Explore the rich datasets through dynamic <b>choropleth maps</b>, providing an illuminating visual representation of <b>geographic-related data</b> for a comprehensive understanding of women's representation in positions of <b>Power & Decision Making</b> across Europe.<br><br>
            
            These dynamic maps offer an engaging way to interpret and analyze the distribution of key metrics across different European countries. The use of color gradients allows for quick comprehension of variations, making it easier to discern patterns, trends, and disparities in gender representation.<br><br>
            
            It's important to note that in cases where the value is undefined, it signifies that the country is either geographically part of Europe but not a member of the EU, or that the specific data is not available for the selected country. Notably, the dataset still includes pertinent information for the United Kingdom, ensuring a thorough examination of its unique context.<br><br>
            
            By leveraging choropleth maps, we aim to provide a nuanced exploration of the gender landscape in positions of influence and decision-making, 
            fostering a deeper understanding of the complexities and variations within the European context.
             These visualizations can serve as powerful tools for researchers, policymakers, and the general public alike,

             yearly explorable time frame that goes from <b>2017 to 2023.</b><br><br> Please keep in mind that EIGE has not any available data for the dataset D3 -  Men and Women in EU Research Funding Organizations for the year 2023.<br><br>
             <h4>D6 - Major Political Parties Leaders in the EU (Men and Women):</h4>
            
             This dataset visualizes the gender distribution of leaders within major political parties across European Union member states.
              Each country is color-coded on the choropleth map to represent the proportion of male and female leaders within its political landscape.
               The intensity of color variations provides a quick and insightful overview of gender
              representation at the helm of influential political parties, fostering a nuanced understanding of political leadership dynamics in the EU.<br><br>
             <h4>D4 - EU Executives for Climate (Men and Women):</h4>
             The choropleth map for this dataset offers a visual representation of the gender composition among executives
              dedicated to climate-related initiatives within the European Union. By employing distinct color gradients, the map vividly illustrates the distribution of men and women in leadership roles tasked with shaping and implementing climate policies. This visualization facilitates 
             an exploration of gender diversity in key positions crucial to addressing environmental
              challenges and promoting sustainable practices across EU member states.<br><br>
             <h4>D3 - Men and Women in EU Research Funding Organizations:</h4>
             This choropleth map highlights the gender distribution among professionals
              within research funding organizations across Europe. The map employs varying colors
               to showcase the proportion of men and women actively engaged in supporting and shaping
                research initiatives. By presenting a geographical overview, the visualization provides
                 valuable insights into the gender dynamics within the realms of research funding, shedding
                  light on the extent of gender representation in organizations pivotal to advancing scientific knowledge and innovation throughout the EU.<br><br>

            <h4>D2 - European agencies: presidents, members and executive heads</h4><p>
            European agencies are decentralized bodies of the European Union (EU) established to carry out specific tasks and functions across various policy areas. 
      These agencies operate independently and are tasked with providing expertise, support, and coordination to EU member states. Their roles encompass 
      a wide range of areas, including <b>regulatory oversight, scientific research, and implementation of EU policies.</b><br><br>

      The organizational structure of European agencies typically includes a leadership team, such as a president or executive head, 
      and a membership comprising representatives from EU member states. These agencies play a crucial role in facilitating collaboration
       and harmonizing efforts among member states in areas where shared expertise and resources are beneficial.<br><br>
      
      The specific functions and responsibilities of European agencies vary depending on their mandate, which may cover domains such as <b>environment, 
      food safety, aviation safety, and more</b>. The agencies contribute to the effective implementation of EU policies
      , ensuring consistent standards and best practices across the member states.<br><br>
      
      In summary, European agencies form an integral part of the EU's administrative framework, functioning as specialized entities that enhance cooperation, coordination, and the efficient execution of policies in specific domains for the benefit of all member states.</p>

          Our dynamic line chart presentation allows the user to choose from three distinct organizational perspectives:
           the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the European Investment Fund (EIF).
          <ul><li><b>The European Investment Bank (EIB):</b><br><br>

           The EIB, established in 1958, operates as the long-term lending institution of the EU.
            With a mission to foster sustainable development, the EIB finances projects spanning
             infrastructure, innovation, climate action, and support for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
              Led by a dedicated President, the EIB plays a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of the EU.</li><br>
           <li><b>European Central Bank (ECB):</b><br><br>           
           At the heart of monetary policy in the eurozone, the ECB, founded in 1998, is tasked with maintaining price stability and ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets
           . Guided by a President and an Executive Board, the ECB issues the euro currency and plays a critical role in shaping the economic trajectory of the eurozone.</li><br>
           <li><b>European Investment Fund (EIF):</b><br><br>
           
           Operating within the European Investment Bank Group, the EIF is dedicated to supporting Europe's micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
            Led by a Chief Executive, the EIF provides guarantees and equity financing, fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and job creation as an integral part of the EU's economic ecosystem.</li></ul><br>
            Together, these institutions form a dynamic trio, each with its unique focus and mandate, working in tandem to drive economic growth, financial stability, and innovation within the European Union.<br>

    <h4>D5 - European courts: presidents and members</h4>
    <p>
      Legal institutions collectively contribute to the <b>development and interpretation of EU law</b>,
       ensuring the protection of rights, the resolution of disputes, and the maintenance of legal consistency within the European Union.<br><br>

      <ul><li><b>Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU):</b><br>

The CJEU is the supreme judicial authority of the EU. It ensures the uniform application and interpretation of EU law across all member states. 
Comprising the Court of Justice, the General Court, and specialized courts, the CJEU plays a critical role in safeguarding 
legal consistency and protecting the rights of individuals and entities under EU law.</li><br>
<li><b>Civil Service Tribunal:</b><br>

The Civil Service Tribunal is one of the specialized courts within the CJEU. It specifically deals with cases involving disputes between the EU and its
 staff, including issues related to employment, working conditions, and disputes arising from staff members' roles within EU institutions.</li><br>
<li><b>European Court of Human Rights (ECHR):</b><br>

The ECHR, based in Strasbourg, is not an EU institution but a body of the Council of Europe.
 It safeguards human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe. Individuals can bring cases
  against member states for alleged violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, ensuring a regional framework for human rights protection.</li><br>
<li><b>European Court of Justice (ECJ):</b><br>

The ECJ is one of the key institutions of the EU, serving as the highest court in matters of EU law.
 It interprets EU legislation, ensures its uniform application, and settles legal disputes between member states, institutions, and individuals.
  The ECJ plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law within the EU.</li><br>
<li><b>General Court:</b>

Also part of the CJEU, the General Court is responsible for hearing cases brought by individuals,
 businesses, and, in some instances, member states against EU institutions. It serves as a court of first instance for certain types of actions, 
 offering an avenue for legal review and redress within the EU's judicial framework.</li><br>

          <h2>Datasets</h2>
          <h3>Check the <span>Source Datasets</span> we used</h3>
     
        </div>
<p>The project comprises the use of <b>10 different datasets</b>, between source ones and mashup ones.
  Each source dataset was divided in three parts for women, men and total values, so - practically - we worked with 18 source datasets and 2 mash up datasets.
  
  The <b>source datasets</b> have been downloaded in .csv and .json format from the Women and men in decision-making section in EIGE's <b><a href="https://eige.europa.eu/gender-statistics/dgs">Gender Statistics Database.</a></b><br><br>
  
  It's essential to recognize the inherent complexities and limitations that accompany our exploration of gender representation in Power & Decision Making across Europe. While our datasets meticulously capture the dynamics between women and men,
   it's important to acknowledge the <b>inherent constraint of a binary representation</b>, as we regrettably do not encompass the rich and diverse spectrum of queer and non-binary identities.<br><br>

  Data, as a reflection of societal structures and categorizations, can sometimes fall short in capturing the multifaceted nature of human experiences. The absence of representation for queer and non-binary individuals in our datasets prompts 
  a broader reflection on the challenges of quantifying dimensions of identity that transcend traditional parameters. As we navigate this data landscape, it becomes an opportunity for introspection, challenging us to critically examine the 
  limitations of our categorical frameworks and consider how these frameworks might inadvertently marginalize certain voices and experiences.<br><br>
  
  This contemplation on the limitations of our data invites us to envision more inclusive and comprehensive approaches to data collection in the future. It prompts us to question not only what is measured but also <b>what is left unmeasured</b>, urging us to strive for data that authentically reflects the richness of diverse identities.
   In essence, our exploration of data is not just a numerical exercise but a thoughtful journey into the complexities of representation, challenging us to continually refine our understanding of societal dynamics and the narratives embedded within the numbers.<br><br>

          <h2>Datasets</h2>
          <h3>Check the <span> Mashup Datasets</span> we created</h3>
     
        </div>
        <div id="visua">
       <p>
        The decision to create separate mashup datasets for geographically related data <b>(MD1)</b>
         containing names of individual countries in the EU and another
          for data containing different organizations of the EU <b>(MD2)</b> is likely driven
           by the distinct nature and purpose of each dataset, as well as the intended use cases for visualization or analysis.<br><br>
           The distinctions between geographically related information and organizational data within the European Union are marked by their emphasis on different parameters — space and time, respectively.

           <br><br><b>MD1 - Geographically Related Data (Space):</b> Geographical data revolves around parameters linked to space, encapsulating the physical dimensions,
            locations, and boundaries of countries within the European Union. Key spatial parameters include latitude and longitude coordinates, land area,
             population density, and features like mountains or rivers. Spatial analysis techniques, such as mapping libraries and geographic information system (GIS)
              tools, are commonly employed to visualize and analyze these spatial dimensions.<br><br>
           
           <b>MD2 - Organization-Related Data (Time):</b> In contrast, organizational data is immersed in parameters tied to time,
            focusing on the temporal aspects of EU institutions, agencies, and bodies. Temporal parameters may include establishment dates,
             tenure durations, historical changes in organizational structures, and milestones in the development of the EU. Understanding the evolution of EU
              organizations over time is critical for temporal analysis, providing insights into historical development and structural dynamics.<br><br>
           
           <b>Integration for Comprehensive Insights:</b> Recognizing that organizational data has both spatial and temporal dimensions, integrating
            both aspects becomes essential for comprehensive insights. This integration allows for a nuanced understanding of the historical development
             and geographical distribution of EU structures. For example, it enables an exploration of how the functions of EU institutions have evolved 
             over time in response to geopolitical changes.<br><br>
           
           <b>Visualization Techniques:</b> Geographical data finds expression through spatial visualization techniques such as choropleth maps, heatmaps, or geographical scatter plots. These visualizations emphasize the spatial distribution of data points, facilitating the exploration of patterns across different regions. On the other hand, organizational data benefits from temporal visualization techniques, including timelines, Gantt charts, or interactive graphs showcasing changes over time.
            These visualizations offer a means to explore historical events, leadership transitions, and organizational developments.<br><br>
           
           <b>Data Modeling and Structures:</b> Geographical data is typically modeled to capture spatial relationships and attributes, utilizing tools like spatial databases, geoJSON formats, and geospatial indexing. In contrast, organizational data requires modeling that accommodates temporal aspects, such as effective dating for changes in organizational structures, historical records, and timelines. Temporal databases or versioning mechanisms may be employed to manage time-related data.
           
           By considering the distinct parameters of space and time for geographically related and organizational data, respectively, tailored dataset structures, analytical methods, and visualization techniques can be applied. This comprehensive approach allows for a more profound exploration of both spatial and temporal dimensions, providing a holistic understanding of the intricate interactions within the European Union.

          <h3>Clusters</h3></div>
          <p>Clusterization, also known as clustering or cluster analysis, 
            is a data analysis technique used to group similar data points into distinct
             subsets or clusters based on certain characteristics or features. The primary
              goal of clusterization is to identify inherent patterns and structures within a dataset,
               allowing for a more organized and insightful understanding of the underlying data.

            <p>Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables change together. 
              In other words, it quantifies the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two sets of data. 
              Correlation does not imply causation; it simply indicates whether and how two variables tend to vary together. You can discover more on the correlation measures that we used in our <a href="#documentation">Documentation</a></p>

        <p>
          The Gender Statistics Database, from where we retrieved the data, 
          contains gender statistics from all over the European Union (EU) and beyond,
           at the EU, Member State and European level. <br>
           It is aimed at providing statistical evidence which can be used to support and complement the European Commission’s
            (EC) Strategy on Gender Equality and support the Member States to monitor their progress.
          <br><br>
